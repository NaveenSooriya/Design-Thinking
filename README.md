Revolutionising Logistics – The Implementation of Drone Delivery Services A Design Thinking Approach to “Last Mile” Drone Delivery

# Executive summary

E-commerce and online delivery are one of the world's largest industries. The ease of ordering, receiving, and returning orders has made online buying more convenient than in- person shopping. The Internet of Things has transformed our way of life. Almost every element of our life is affected by IoT, from the simplification of routine jobs to the improvement of home security.
Online delivery has created opportunities for small businesses and start-ups. Consumers like online shopping not just because to its convenience, but also due to the firm’s extensive range of products and services. This development has enabled even the tiniest businesses to offer their items online, providing users with a variety of possibilities.

Users are accustomed to the convenience of ordering anything and everything online, owing to the accessibility and convenience of the Internet. Possibly anything is available online, from food, groceries, and medications to clothing, accessories, electrical devices, and building supplies. The corporations have utilised the scenario to their benefit by penetrating the market with exceptional products and services that compete with one another. As competition intensified, businesses began to provide better services and goods, and now consumers have the upper hand in the market and can demand better service.

Now that clients are accustomed to receiving exceptional service, the delivery services must be impeccable. The last mile delivery is the most important and costly step of online delivery service, and practically all organisations are striving to provide superior service and prompt delivery to obtain a competitive edge.

In the past several years, the companies have developed the most effective strategies for achieving the finest last-mile delivery. The freight modes of delivery services aim to deliver items as quickly as possible, however owing to a variety of challenges, the majority of businesses are unable to meet the needs of their customers. Customers need efficient service, precise tracking, product safety, and faster delivery. Additionally, consumers are worried about the environmental effect of the entire service. Consequently, it is challenging to meet all user requirements.

The use of drones for last-mile deliveries has grown increasingly common. Traditional delivery techniques have a variety of disadvantages compared to drone delivery, including slower delivery times, higher prices, and inferior customer satisfaction. In addition to the ease and swiftness of delivery, drone delivery services also provide enhanced client experience. Drones may fly straight to the client's location, so the consumer does not need to leave their home to pick up their delivery. Moreover, drones enable real-time tracking, allowing consumers to follow their packages from the moment they are picked up until they are delivered. By reducing carbon emissions, it also prevents detrimental environmental effects.

Customers cannot reasonably rely on drone delivery service due to its inherent constraints like noise, safety, privacy factors, damage. Due to legal limits and safety laws, businesses are also hesitant to utilise it routinely.

The SPARROW drone delivery system is the company's most recent innovation. The solution is designed to easily solve the majority of drone delivery challenges. BMT's innovative approach provides a revolutionary delivery alternative appropriate for uncertain, unprepared, or delicate circumstances. SPARROW is a lightweight and nimble hanging robot that allows drones to remain securely at 400 ft above obstacles and people, unseen and unheard. The SPARROW method is the answer for optimal speed range, payload capacities, and general drone delivery problems.

This dissertation is a consulting project for the company BMT, which has built the SPARROW drone to provide market-based delivery services. The objective of the project is to analyse the need for drone delivery services in the UK market and to get an understanding of consumer expectations, which will assist to define the project's scope and provide viable solutions. To assess client views in last mile delivery and co-create value between BMT and its customers, a design thinking methodology is implemented.

Design thinking is a iterative approach to problem-solving that focuses on identifying user requirements and developing solutions to meet those requirements. It is an iterative process consisting of ideation, prototyping, and testing until the ideal answer is established. In order to provide innovative solutions, it encourages collaboration, empathy, innovation, and testing.

At each and every level of the process, the user-centric approach is utilised to comprehend the user's wants and to build a design and service that is relevant to those demands. The hybrid research is performed by integrating both primary and secondary research in order to collect data to understand improve the service.
The analysis reveals that SPARROW should collaborate with businesses that provide services for apparel, accessories, and electronic goods that are currently in high demand. The report contains a detailed description of the user's expectations to be incorporated into the system's design. As design thinking is an iterative process, the end solution cannot be offered; thus, the project must grasp the requirements and do analysis throughout to keep the product moving forward to acquire the market share and to attain profitability.

Ultimately, the BMT's SPARROW is an excellent drone delivery service that is capable of penetrating the market. Based on the study, it meets the majority of consumer expectations, and by enhancing the service using a design-thinking approach, the SPARROW could be a dominant player.
The findings of this study are both conceptually and theoretically significant, offering useful insights into the application of design thinking to the delivery sector and influencing the development of best practices.
